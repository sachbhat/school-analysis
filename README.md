# school-analysis

## Overview

I'll add more details soon, but this is a work-in-progress on a public dataset that I'm using to learn Python, Pandas, NumPy, and the various graphing libraries. It also helps that I'm interested in the dataset and exploring the problem space around education.

There are a few files so far:

- [helpers.py](./helpers.py) : As the name describes, a set of python helper functions that I'm using in the notebook.

- [Exploratory Analysis](./Exploratory Analysis - School Data.ipynb): This is a playground to understand underlying datsets

- [Test Success Rates of 3rd Graders in Washington.ipynb](Test Success Rates of 3rd Graders in Washington.ipynb): This is an attempt at telling a story with the data. It's too early to tell what that story is.

Enjoy the view. And let me know if you have questions.
